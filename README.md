## Synopsis

Note: 	text file = dataOut.txt <br />
	data binary file = clients.dat <br />
	index binary file = lastname.idx <br />
	
This project teaches you how to read from a text file, creates a data binary file with the data in the text file, converts the data binary file into an index binary file and displays the data in various ways (i.e. sorting by last name, natural order etc).

## Code Example

I started the project by building each feature one by one.  If you try to learn the code from scratch or build a project this big by doing everything at once, there is a strong chance you will fail. 

 My recommendation is to try to build this piece by piece in the following order:

1) Build the convert.c file and display.c

convert.c should be able to read a text file and create a data binary file (with the data inside the text file)<br />
display.c should be able to read from the data binary file and display the data onto the console<br />

2) Build index.c and modify convert.c and display.c

convert.c file should be able to read from the data binary file and create a index file (index.c) with useful information (i.e. data key, file position) <br/>

//TODO have multiple indices in one index file, right now itâ€™s just one index (lastname, file position)<br />
display.c file should be able to read the index file, grab the file position stored inside the index, and then use the file position to locate the account data inside the data binary file<br />

3) Build a main.c file, datadefs.h, convert.h, index.h, display.h and modify the old files to include the appropriate header files to reduce code repetition <br/>

The biggestest challenge in refractoring my code to different header files is getting a redefinition error.  In order to debug it, I would define the struct in different headers to see what worked and what didn't. My error was fixed by including datadefs.h once in main.c, and in all other header files (covert.h, index.h and display.h).  I didn't have to include the other source files in main.c.  In the other source files (covert.c, index.c and display.c) I included the appropriate header files (covert.h, index.h and display.h). I think my redefinition error occured because I tried to include the other source files in main.c, and somewhere the program tried to redefine the code inside.  It was hard to debug because the debugger wouldn't jump to a file twice, it just threw the error.

The above method worked, but I also added a guard in datadef.h; thereby, preventing redefinition errors when I include this in multiple places.

#ifndef DATADEFS_H //explantions on guard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard<br />
#define DATADEFS_H<br />
//code<br />
#endif // !DATADEFS.H<br />

main.c should include the datadefs.h, display a menu to convert, index, display natural order, display by last name ascending order, and exit <br />

//TODO after adding more sorting feature, remember to add more options in the menu<br />

other header files should include datadefs.h (because it stores main struct and program definitions)<br />
all other source code (convert.c, index.c, display.c) should have no main function and include the appropriate header files<br />

Note: I borrowed code from different places and modified them when I needed too - borrowed code are noted down in source files<br />

## Motivation

This project exist because it was assign to me.  However, I find it useful in a lot of application that I am building and wanted to share the code.  The most difficult part about the whole project was not knowing what to do when the data was displaying incorrectly.  Since the assignment required the data to be stored in binary, it was not easy to just check if the data was written out correctly.  Fortunately, Hynek showed me how I could start fixing the problem.  Hynek told me I had to make sure the data binary files contained all the right data first.  So Hynek wrote me some code to read the data binary file to see the messed up data and then I went on fixing from there.

## Installation

In order to run this code, you need an integrated development environment like Visual Studio. This program is created using Visual Studio 2015 and started with an empty Win32 Console Application.

In order to execute, cmd line arguments need to be inputted in VS like this:
